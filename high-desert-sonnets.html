        <p class="lead-paragraph giga">In February, over 500 guests gathered at the National Arts Centre for an evening of poetry accompanied by videos. I had the pleasure of designing the event branding and materials for the evening.</p>
        <p class="lead-text">The client had spent 1 month in the New Mexico desert writting sonnets. When he came home, he approached Simple Story to help with the creation of videos and branding for the project to eventually share his work and story with family and friends.</p>

      <p class="milli push-0">The primary imagery for this brand was greatly inspired by the desert and notable elements from the client’s journey. I started by creating a logo that would work accross all materials. The words were manipulated to emulate the desert dunes and mountains.</p>

    <h2 class="giga push-1-2">Event Posters</h2>
    <p class="milli push-0">The team decided to create two event posters. The first design features the desert within the silhouette of the poet, keeping in mind the warm and rugged style. The second focuses on an important area for the poet: the bench he would frequent every morning during his journey.</p>

      <p class="milli push-0">Here’s a look at the playbill I designed for the evening. Each page features artwork from the sonnet’s video. Having the titles and backgrounds treated similarly created a consistent feel throughout despite the different art styles.</p>
